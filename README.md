## Hi there 👋

- 🎓 My journey has been starting since **2013** after I attended **HUST**. Although my major was **Electronics**, I was passionate about **IT**, so I had to study it by myself during university time. Finally, I graduated in **2018** without having much knowledge about Electronics.
- 🏢 After graduating, I've got a Samsung scholarship and started working at **SVMC** as a **Backend Developer** since then. This is my first official job in my life and I was so glad and excited about it!
- 🌱 My experiences:
  - 6/2018 - 3/2021: **SVMC** (a R&D Center of Samsung)
  - 4/2021 - 7/2022: **IFI solution** (a small outsourcing company for customers mostly from Europe and America)
  - 8/2022 - 1/2024: **ASCEND Technology** (a product company for customers in ASEAN, it belongs to Ascend Corporation in Thailand). I worked onsite for Ascend VN from 8/2022 - 6/2023, then worked remotely for Ascend Malaysia from 8/2023 - 1/2024)
  - 1/2024 - present: **Deputy** (a product company from Australia)
- My primary tech stacks: Java (Spring), Javascript (ReactJS, VueJS, Gatsby), SQL (MySQL, Postgres), Redis, RabbitMQ
- My personal project:
  - [Lili Player](https://anhtuta.github.io/lili-player/#/bai-hat): a music player that focuses mainly on lyrics and karaoke effects
  - https://nenmongvietnam.com: an e-commerce website using Gatsby and ReactJS
